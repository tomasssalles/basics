# basics
Textbook implementations of CS basics in rust.

## Sorting

- [x] Bubblesort.
- [x] Quicksort.
- [x] Mergesort.
- [x] Mergesort with only O(log(n)) additional space.
- [x] Max-Heap (on array).
- [x] Heapsort.
- [x] "All occurrences" binary search.

## ML

### Neural networks
Just a toy implementation sufficient to tackle the MNIST database. The data
files are assumed to be in {project-root}/resources (which is git-ignored),
unzipped.
